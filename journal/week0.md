Taks I completed this week include: 
-Setting up AWS CLI with Gitpod.
-Writing code to set up budgets and billing.
-Setting MFA for my AWS IAM roles with security credentials 

Challenges I faced: 
- Setting the correct budget code, discovered that my lines were incorrect which then made my whole code not work used google to assist in solving this issue.
- Connecting AWS CLI to gitpod, selecting the wrong code meant the set up could not complete. Corrected that.
- Building off of the napkin diagram is challenging, and may continue to build up on the napkin diagram so as to give Crudder the best and most affordable features available 
- I built the correct code & followed the tutorial for alarm billing for cloudwatch, however, i kept receiving the cannot find file code, created the cloudwatch alarm using AWS console insteadd.
- I reviewed all the questions of each pillar in the Well Architected Too
