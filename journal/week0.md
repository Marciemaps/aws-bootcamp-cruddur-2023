Taks I completed this week include: 
-Setting up AWS CLI with Gitpod.
-Writing code to set up budgets and billing.
-Setting MFA for my AWS IAM roles with security credentials 

Challenges I faced: 
- Setting the correct budget code, discovered that my lines were incorrect which then made my whole code not work.
- Connecting AWS CLI to gitpod, selecting the wrong code meant the set up could not complete. Corrected that.
- Building off of the napkin diagram is challenging, and may continue to build up on the napkin diagram so as to give Crudder the best and most affordable features available
